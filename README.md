## <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43c950fd-76fc-4a81-804b-57e89642eb8c" alt="overview" height="30px"> Overview
This research project focuses on the prediction of **environmental pollution** levels—specifically air quality, **PM2.5 concentration**, and temperature-driven pollution dynamics—through the use of historical environmental datasets.
To enhance predictive performance, the study employs the **Jaya Optimization Algorithm**, which is utilized to fine-tune machine learning models. The algorithm improves both accuracy and stability of predictions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Unlike conventional optimization techniques, **Jaya is parameter-independent**, eliminating the need for algorithm-specific control parameters. This simplicity, coupled with its robustness, makes Jaya particularly well-suited for real-world environmental prediction tasks.

The proposed framework demonstrates potential as a scalable and adaptable solution for pollution forecasting, contributing to applications in environmental monitoring, smart city infrastructure, and evidence-based policymaking.
