designed for real-time air quality forecasting. It cleverly combines deep learning with the Jaya optimization algorithm to provide users with accurate, efficient, and easily accessible predictions for key pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, and AQI—all right in their web browser. This means no more waiting on servers or dealing with annoying delays.

At the heart of this project is a highly efficient optimization pipeline. By using the Jaya algorithm to fine-tune the weights of linear equations, we’ve created a model that’s not only precise but also lightweight in terms of computation. Our evaluations show that this method achieves a remarkable 20-25% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to traditional Linear Regression models, based on a decade's worth of integrated meteorological, traffic, and pollution data. Plus, thanks to the in-browser implementation with TensorFlow.js, we can deliver real-time predictions in under 2 seconds for a standard dataset, proving that client-side applications can perform exceptionally well.

Here are some key contributions and validated outcomes:

★ Superior Predictive Performance: The Jaya-optimized model consistently outshines benchmark algorithms, boasting an impressive average R² score of over 0.92 across prediction tasks for PM2.5, PM10, and AQI. This indicates a strong fit and excellent explanatory power.

★ Computational Efficiency: Thanks to its parameter-free design and minimal computational demands, the algorithm converges quickly (within 100-200 iterations) and trains rapidly right in the browser. This is a significant advantage over more complex models like Random Forests or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which just aren’t practical for this kind of deployment.

★ Enhanced Generalization: By integrating and preprocessing data from multiple sources—including special events and congestion indices—the model effectively captures complex, non-linear relationships. This results in a more robust and adaptable predictive capability.When looking at various seasonal trends and unusual pollution events, we can see clear evidence through the analysis of interactive heatmaps.


★ Practical Deployment & Scalability: The whole system is designed with practicality in mind, meaning it doesn’t need any backend infrastructure. This makes it a scalable and budget-friendly option for widespread use by policymakers, researchers, and the general public, especially in areas where computational resources are limited.

In summary, Pollution Predictor offers an exciting framework for the future of environmental monitoring tools. It strikes a great balance between high accuracy, computational efficiency, and user-friendliness. Future developments will aim to integrate spatial data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build spatiotemporal models, incorporate real-time IoT data streams for live updates, and enhance the framework with probabilistic forecasting to address uncertainty. This research sets the stage for smart, AI-driven systems that can genuinely aid in sustainable urban development and proactive public health advisories.
