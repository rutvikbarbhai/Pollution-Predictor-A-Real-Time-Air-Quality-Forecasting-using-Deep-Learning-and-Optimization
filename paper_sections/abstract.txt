Abstractâ€”Air pollution poses a severe threat to public health, ecosystems, and climate stability, driven by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and vehicular emissions. Accurate forecasting of air quality is essential for proactive mitigation strategies, public health awareness, and regulatory compliance. This study presents Pollution Predictor, a machine learning-based system that leverages historical pollution data to predict future air quality levels. The system analyzes key air quality parameters, including the Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations, using TensorFlow.js for real-time model inference. The model integrates advanced feature engineering techniques and deep learning algorithms to capture seasonal and temporal variations in pollution trends. The proposed approach is designed to provide an accessible, web-based interactive platform that enables users to visualize air quality predictions through heatmaps, enhancing interpretability and decision-making.

Recent research in air pollution prediction has explored hybrid deep learning techniques, regression-based models, and remote sensing data integration to improve forecasting accuracy. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of models such as CNN-LSTM hybrids, support vector regression (SVR), and ensemble learning in capturing spatial-temporal pollution patterns. However, challenges such as computational overhead, real-time deployment, and model generalization persist. The Pollution Predictor addresses these limitations by balancing predictive accuracy with computational efficiency, ensuring scalability across different geographic regions. Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure robustness and reliability. This research highlights the significance of predictive analytics in environmental monitoring and underscores the role of AI-driven solutions in sustainable urban development. The system serves as a foundation for future advancements in pollution forecasting, contributing to smart city initiatives and improved air quality management strategies.
